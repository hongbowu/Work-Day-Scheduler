# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description:

Work Day Scheduler is a simple work tracking tool designed for ease of use in recording and monitoring work progress. The application allows users to plan their daily tasks within specific hourly time slots. By entering and saving work plans for each hour and observing the real-time status of time—past, present, and future—the user can assess whether their work is progressing as planned. Each status is visually represented with distinct colors, facilitating easy differentiation.
